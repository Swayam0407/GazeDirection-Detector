# Gaze Direction Classifier

This is a React application that classifies gaze direction (left, right, up, or down) using a photo. The app leverages the `landingai-react` library to interact with the Landing AI's inference API.

**Image Upload and Analysis**: 
- Allows users to upload images and classify gaze direction.
- **Real-time Inference**: Uses Landing AI's API for immediate classification results.

## Project Workflow

1. **Image Collection**: Users can upload an image via the `PhotoCollector` component.
2. **API Interaction**: The app sends the image to the Landing AI API for inference.
3. **Result Display**: The classified result (gaze direction) is displayed alongside the image.
